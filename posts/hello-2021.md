2020 has been a challenging year, to say the least. Nonetheless, the team has made the best of a difficult situation. Despite an already massive user base, Vue's [NPM downloads](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=vue&from=2020-01-01&to=2020-12-31) and [Devtools weekly active users](https://chrome-stats.com/d/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd) both grew close to 50% throughout 2020. As time of this writing, Vue is being downloaded ~8M times per month on NPM and the devtools extension has ~1.5M weekly active users.
